\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {}Trapping DNA in a cavity near a solid-state nanopore would enable for the outcome of biochemical reactions to be probed. DNA is a polymer of particular interest because it propagates life as we know it. Using four bases - A, T, C and G - DNA encodes for the behavior of cells in every living thing, from bacteria to trees to whales. Due to DNAâ€™s incredible information density (most recently estimated at 2.2 petabytes per gram), another hot topic in DNA research is information storage and retrieval. An entropic trap could provide a long-term storage system for DNA, enabling humanity to finally do away with tape backups. We believe entropic trapping can be achieved through extremely precise manipulation of forces driving DNA in and around a nanopore, specifically through control electronics.}{4}{}}
